# tic-tac-toe
A Simple Tic-Tac-Toe Browser game with a focus on modular JS and no global variables

After learning a multitude on prototypal inheritance, closures,
factory functions, destructuring objects/arrays, scoping, and, 
the Module pattern: IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions).

This project aims to use these ideas and tools to produce
a simple browser version of tic-tac-toe that limits the
amount of global variables by creating modular method 
containing objects which can interact with one another
without being exposed to edits from users.
