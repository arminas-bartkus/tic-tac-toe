# tic-tac-toe
A Simple Tic-Tac-Toe Browser game with a focus on modular JS and no global variables

After learning a multitude on prototypal inheritance, closures,
factory functions, destructuring objects/arrays, scoping, and, 
the Module pattern: IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions).

This project aims to use these ideas and tools to produce
a simple browser version of tic-tac-toe that limits the
amount of global variables by creating modular method 
containing objects which can interact with one another
without being exposed to edits from users.

This also helps with the security of functions and variables
by making them inaccessible through the console and therefore
tamper proof.
